"""
QScrollArea's default wheel handling moves the scrollbar in one abrupt
jump per wheel "tick" (Qt applies the whole step, no easing) -- fine for
short lists, but reported as feeling "snappy" on the Library grid, which
can be many rows tall. SmoothScrollArea overrides wheel handling to
animate to the target position instead of jumping there, using an
eased QPropertyAnimation on the vertical scrollbar's own `value`
property so everything else about QScrollArea (resizing, the existing
scrollbar widget, keyboard/drag scrolling) is untouched.

Multiple quick wheel ticks (a fast scroll) accumulate onto the SAME
in-flight animation's end value rather than starting a new animation
each time -- restarting from the current (mid-animation) position would
feel like it's fighting itself; extending the existing target instead
gives one continuous, smoothly-accelerating scroll for a fast swipe.
