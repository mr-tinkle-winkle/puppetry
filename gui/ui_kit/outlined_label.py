"""
A QLabel that draws its text with a colored outline (stroke) behind a
colored fill, instead of QLabel's own plain (outline-less) rendering --
the default styling for all on-card text (title, info/date lines, tag
names), per request for readable text over the info box's
accent-colored background.

Renders into a cached QPixmap rather than re-stroking the glyph path on
every paintEvent -- reported directly as low frame rate during Library
scrolling despite the scroll MOVEMENT itself being smooth, which points
at per-frame repaint cost rather than the scroll animation itself.
Every card has up to four of these (title, info/date lines, tag names),
and building a QPainterPath from glyph outlines plus a double stroke+
fill pass is real work to repeat on every single repaint a scrolling
grid triggers, for text that never actually changes between refreshes.
The cache is invalidated only on an actual content change (setText,
set_colors) or a size change (picked up lazily in paintEvent, same
"only recompute when something real changed" principle as
VideoCard/_InfoBox's own background caching -- see video_card.py).
