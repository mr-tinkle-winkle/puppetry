"""
The ONE place the UI kit reads its settings from.

Every widget in ui_kit calls `get_settings()` and reads fields off the
returned ThemeSettings. Nothing in the kit knows where an app keeps its
config. The host app wires that up once at startup:

    from ui_kit import theme_config
    theme_config.set_settings_provider(lambda: my_app_config.load().theme)

The provider must return a ThemeSettings instance (or any object with the
same attribute names). It's called often: from constructors and from
some paintEvents. It MUST be cheap. Cache the config, or re-read the
file only when its mtime changes. Afterglow measured 400+ calls per
Library refresh when its load() re-parsed TOML every time, and that was
over half the refresh time. See UI_THEMING_GUIDE.md, section 7, pitfall 1.

If no provider is set, the kit uses a module-level default
ThemeSettings(), so widgets still render in the monochrome placeholder
scheme. That's handy for tests and demos.

Colors differ per app on purpose. Each app keeps its own ThemeSettings
defaults and its own saved values. Don't import another app's palette.
