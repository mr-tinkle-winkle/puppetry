"""
A rounded, theme-colored button replacing native/KDE-styled QToolButtons
-- the "Custom Buttons" setting's actual implementation. Used for the
Library's Search/Refresh/Filters/Sort By/Info row for now; the Local/
Uploaded page switcher is a separate, bigger piece of work still using
the native QTabBar (see HANDOFF.md).

Subclasses QToolButton (not QPushButton) specifically so existing
QToolButton-only features -- setPopupMode(InstantPopup) + setMenu(),
already used by Filters/Sort By/Info -- keep working completely
unchanged; only the PAINTING is replaced, not the click/popup behavior.
