"""
A short "grow out of the button that triggered it" animation, used for
the Sort popover and the Settings page's tab switching -- per a
direct request, instead of an instant swap (or a plain fade), both
should visually appear to scale outward from whichever button opened
them.

Two different mechanisms because the two things being revealed aren't
the same kind of widget:
- SortPopover is a genuine top-level popup (Qt.Popup window) -- its own
  geometry can be animated directly, since nothing else's layout
  depends on it.
- The Settings tab pages live inside a QStackedWidget, whose layout
  fully owns and re-asserts each page's geometry -- animating a page's
  real geometry would just get fought and overridden by that layout on
  the very next layout pass. Instead, ScaleRevealOverlay grabs a
  snapshot of the page (already correctly placed and fully visible
  underneath, an instant swap happened as normal) and animates a
  temporary copy of that snapshot growing from the button's position
  up to the real page's rect, then deletes itself -- the real page was
  never touched or delayed, only briefly covered by the animated copy.
