"""
Replaces native/KDE QGroupBox chrome (used for every "section" header
in Settings, plus tag-category grouping in the Sort popover's Filters
page) with a custom-painted rounded box and title, matching the rest
of the Afterglow custom-widget system.

Deliberately a drop-in for the exact construction pattern already used
everywhere: `group = CustomGroupBox("Title")` then
`layout = QVBoxLayout(group)` (or QFormLayout, etc.) works completely
unchanged at every call site -- this box applies its own reserved
margins (room at the top for the painted title) to whatever layout
gets attached, both via a setLayout() override AND, as a second,
independent guarantee, again in showEvent() right before it's ever
actually shown (see showEvent's own comment for why the setLayout()
path alone isn't fully reliable). `widget.setContentsMargins()` called
BEFORE a layout exists does NOT carry over to a layout attached
later -- confirmed directly (a widget's contentsMargins set pre-layout
has no effect; a newly-attached layout falls back to the current
style's own default margins instead). That wrong assumption in an
earlier version of this class is exactly what caused a real reported
bug: every CustomGroupBox was actually laying out its content with
the STYLE's default margins the whole time, not the title-reserving
ones this class was written to use -- meaning the reserved space above
the title never actually existed, misaligning what this box's OWN
paintEvent assumed versus what its content actually needed, and
throwing off any code (like the Sort popover's own page-sizing) that
relied on this box's reported sizeHint being consistent with its real
rendered content.

        sizing, which computes a page's needed height immediately after
