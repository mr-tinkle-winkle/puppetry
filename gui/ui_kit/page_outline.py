"""
A plain 3px, 15%-darker-than-itself outline around each top-level page
(Local, Uploaded, the overall Library page, Editor, Settings) -- per
direct request. Each page uses ITS OWN background color as the
basis (darkened 15%), not one shared border color, since these pages
don't all share the same background. `skip_*` lets a page omit
whichever edge touches something else directly (no gap) -- Local/
Uploaded's own content area skips its top edge, which is flush against
the Library header (search/refresh/sort + the page-switch buttons)
right above it, so the outline doesn't visibly double up or bleed into
that seam.
